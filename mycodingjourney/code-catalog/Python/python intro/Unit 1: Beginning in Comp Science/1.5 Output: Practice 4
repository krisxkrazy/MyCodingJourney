#when you print numbers in a statement they will follow the regular order of operations!
#Note: if you use quotations to turn your statement into a string literal it will print out exactly what you type!

#example one prints the operation 
print (7 * 7 + 22)

#example to is the wrong one! prints a string literal!
print("7 * 7 + 22")
