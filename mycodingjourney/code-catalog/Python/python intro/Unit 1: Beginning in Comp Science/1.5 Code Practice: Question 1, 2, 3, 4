# Code Practice Question 1 

#Write a one-line program to output the following haiku. Keep in mind that for a one-line program, only one print command is used.
#Remember that the escape characters \n and \t can be used to create new lines or tabs for extra spacing.

#this is another example of a quote made using escape charcters 

print("\"Computer Science is no more about computers \nthan astronomy is about telescopes\" \n- Edsger W. Dijkstra")

# Remember that the escape character \\ can be used to write a backslash symbol in your code.

print("              )\n             (\n         ^    )\n        / \ ---\n       /   \| |\n      /  _  \ |\n     /  (_)  \|\n    /         \\ \n   /|   _   _  \ ")
