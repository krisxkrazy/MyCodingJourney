# ****************************************************

#Write a program that uses two input statements to get two words as input. Then, print the words on one line separated by a space. Your program's output should only include the two words and a space between them.

#Hint: To print both words on one line, remember that you can concatenate (add) two phrases by using the + symbol.  Don't forget that you'll need to add a space between the words as well.

word1 = input("Enter a word: ")
word2 = input("Enter a word: ")
print(word1 + " " +  word2)
