#the purpose of this is to learn the input command 
#the input command allows a user to choose what is stored in the variable 
#for example name = input("Whats your name?") 
#that command will prompt a user to input their name and then store it in the variable name!

name = input("What is your name? ")

print("Arigato gozaimasu " + name + " nice to meet you!")

#TRY IT!
#input a name and an adjective and print!

name = input("What is your name? ")
adjective = input("Choose an adjective. ")


print("Arigato! " + name + "," + " nice to see you. You seem very " + adjective + " today.")
