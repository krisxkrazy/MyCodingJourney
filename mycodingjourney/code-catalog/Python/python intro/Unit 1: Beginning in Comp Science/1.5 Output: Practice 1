# ********************************************************************************
# *  this is a practice of storing variables, and how to use them!               *
# *  a variable for example x can store names like kris for example              *
# *  try this x = kris this will store kris in the variable x                    *
# *  do not put quotes around the variable when using it in a print statement!   *
# *  that will turn it into a string literal for example ("Hello")               *
# *  the console when only display letter for letter what has been typed in!     *
