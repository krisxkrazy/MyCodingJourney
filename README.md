## Kris | MyCodingJourning 
[Enjoy!]

Please Enjoy! I have loved computer(s) from a very young age, and played around with things like inspecting page code and playing with it when I was little however it wasn't until around age 15 when my knowledge on computer tech started to really increase and I got into cyber security, at age 16 I decieded to master multiple languages of code and fell in love when seeing the endless creations I could make, and the momentous amount of things I could help build on top of, or modify!

Here's why:
* Document my learning journey, show anyone can learn code given the time & effort.
* Provide a reasonable idea of how much information you will have to gain overtime.
* Give project ideas based on the area of code you are at.
